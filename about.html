Who am I?
</p>
<p>
To cut to the chase; I am a student seeking internships and experience for the next few months.  But there is more than that.
</p>
<p>
  During the day, I study computer science and any other electives that happen to catch my attention.  I chose to enter the Mobile Computing stream at my school, which gives me extra courses to play around and learn about Android and iOS devices.  I'm also pretty involved around campus.  I've been a research assistant one summer, and a teaching assistant during the year.  I usually work with introductory computer science courses because I'm interested in how people with little to no exposure to computer science learn  about the field, and I like the perspectives they bring in.
</p>
<p>
  By night, I play things a little more low-key.  A good night in involves curling up with a good book and hot chocolate.  A good night out involves meeting up with friends at the bar and discussing the past week, the weather, and the occasional terrible pun.
