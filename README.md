The first version of my personal website, using basic HTML and CSS.

## Why?
In order to gain more experience and understand the way websites, web applications and web development works;
I am building a personal website for myself with different technology.

## Version 1
For my first website, I decided to work with the very basics, HTML and CSS. I spent an afternoon following a tutorial
online to learn HTML.  On Josh's recommendation, I added Bootstrap CSS and added my own custom CSS on top.  For fun,
I used Google Fonts to make the site a little more personal.

I also needed to learn about hosting the site.  How I did so, I no longer remember.  I started with the GitHub student 
pack though, and the site is hosted through the Carleton University School of Computer Science [servers](http://www.scs.carleton.ca).

This site is static, simple, and not mobile friendly.  But hey, it's a start.

## Tools
